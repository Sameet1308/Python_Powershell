Implementation Guide: Excel File Import into MicroStrategy via AWS Pipeline

Content:
Overview:
This document outlines the implementation of a new process for importing Excel files into MicroStrategy. This method is designed in response to the restrictions on direct file access from NAS paths.

Objective:
To establish a compliant and efficient mechanism for importing Excel files from NAS paths into MicroStrategy using AWS technology.

Process Workflow:
Source - NAS Path: Original storage location for Excel files.
SIP Tool: Facilitates the transfer of files from NAS to AWS S3.
AWS S3 Storage: Temporary holding area for the Excel files.
AWS Lambda Activation: Triggered upon file upload to S3, initiating the subsequent process.
Glue Crawler Execution: Processes the Excel file data in S3, updating the Glue tables.
Glue Data Catalogue: Updated tables are made available for MicroStrategy analysis.
Implementation Steps:
Excel files are first placed in the designated NAS path.
The SIP tool automatically transfers these files to the AWS S3 bucket.
Upon file upload in S3, an AWS Lambda function is triggered.
The Lambda function, equipped with a Python script, activates the Glue Crawler.
The Glue Crawler reads the Excel file data, updating the Glue Data Catalogue accordingly.
MicroStrategy accesses this data from the updated Glue Data Catalogue.
Advantages:
Adherence to administrative compliance regarding NAS path usage.
Automated data transfer reducing manual handling.
Scalability for handling large data volumes.
Prompt availability of data for MicroStrategy use.
Current Phase:
The process is currently in the Proof of Concept (POC) phase, under active evaluation and optimization.
Responsibilities:
Ensure proper placement and formatting of Excel files in the NAS path.
Regularly monitor the AWS S3 bucket and Lambda function for efficient operation.
Validate the updates in the Glue Crawler and Data Catalogue.
Future Directions:
Complete and assess the POC.
Incorporate improvements based on POC results.
Expand the usage of this process following successful POC validation.

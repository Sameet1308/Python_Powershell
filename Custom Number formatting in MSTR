Custom Number Formatting in MicroStrategy
Introduction
In MicroStrategy, you can customize the formatting of numbers to make them more readable and meaningful for your audience. Whether you’re dealing with financial metrics, quantities, or other numerical data, applying custom formats ensures consistency and clarity.

Common Custom Formats
Below are some common custom number formats you can use in MicroStrategy:

Decimal Places:
To display a number with two decimal places, use the format #.##. For example, if you have the value 123.456, it will be displayed as 123.46.
For one decimal place, use the format #.0#. So, 123.456 becomes 123.5.
Thousands Separator and Currency Symbol:
To format a number with a thousands separator and a custom currency symbol (e.g., “CR” for credits), use #,##0"CR";#,##0" ". For example, 1234.567 will be displayed as 1,235CR.
Negative Numbers:
Format negative numbers differently (e.g., with a “DR” suffix) using #. -#.##. So, -123.45 becomes 123DR.
Percentage Format:
Display a number as a percentage using #.##%. For instance, 0.08 will be shown as 8%.
Date and Time Formats:
Use placeholders like m-d-yy, mm dd, yy, mmm d, yy, and mmmm d, yy for date formatting.
For time, use hh"h" mm"m" and AM/PM.
Custom Text:
Include custom text in your format. For example:
"Sales="0.0: Displays as Sales=123.5.
"X="0.0;"x="-0.0: Shows x=12.3 (positive) and x=-12.34 (negative).
Abbreviations for Large Numbers
Without Abbreviations (B, M, K):
Format for large numbers without abbreviations: [>=1000000000] #.#,,; [>=1000000] #.#,; [>=1000] #.#; 0.
With One Decimal Place:
Format with one decimal place and abbreviations: [>=1000000000] #.#,,\"B\"; [>=1000000] #.#,\"M\"; [>=1000] #.#,\"K\"; 0.
With Two Decimal Places:
Format with two decimal places and abbreviations: [>=1000000000] #.##,,\"B\"; [>=1000000] #.##,\"M\"; [>=1000] #.##,\"K\"; 0.

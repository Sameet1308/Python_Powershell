Hi [Manager's Name],

Hope you’re well. I wanted to reach out for a discussion about my career direction. I’m aiming for a role in Technical Architecture or Data Science and could use your guidance.

- **Career Goal**: I'm enthusiastic about moving into Technical Architecture or Data Science. This is where I see my career heading.
- **Experience and Skills**: In my 8 years here, I've developed a strong skill set in Python, PowerShell, Autosys, and AWS Cloud. These experiences have shaped my ability to provide effective solutions and prepare me for more advanced roles.
- **Beyond Development**: While I enjoy development, I’m also looking to dive into more architecture work and building POCs. It's an area I'm keen to explore further.
- **Next Steps**: I feel it’s time to progress beyond my current role. I'm ready for new challenges and opportunities to grow.
- **Your Advice**: Your insights would be invaluable. A conversation on how I can align my current skills and role with these future goals would mean a lot.

Can we set aside some time to talk about this? I’m flexible and happy to fit into your schedule.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Comparison of Excel Data Import Methods in MSTR
Criteria	Option 1: Direct Import to MSTR Cube using mstrio-py	Option 2: Import into Database as Key-Value Pairs then to MSTR
Simplicity and Speed	More straightforward and faster for smaller datasets.	More steps involved, especially with the universal query.
Complexity of Setup	Less complex as there's no need to manage a separate database.	More complex due to database design, data import processes, and maintenance.
Data Transformation and Validation	Limited options for cleaning and transforming data.	Allows for data validation, cleansing, and transformation.
Data Management and Integrity	Higher risk of incorrect or incomplete data import.	Better data management with database constraints and validations.
Scalability	Not suitable for very large datasets.	More suitable for larger datasets and complex transformations.
Performance Impact on MSTR	Direct import can affect MSTR's performance, especially with large/complex files.	Depends on database performance but generally less direct impact on MSTR.
Real-time Data Reflection	Ideal for frequently updated Excel files.	Some delay depending on the frequency of data refreshes.
Flexibility in Data Consumption	Limited, as data is directly imported without much transformation.	More options for querying and manipulating data.
Data Update Latency	Data can be reflected more immediately.	Potential delay in reflecting the latest data in MSTR.
Security Concerns	Potential risk as direct import might not have robust security measures.	Database can implement stronger security measures.
Data Integrity	Relies heavily on the correctness of the Excel file; less control over data integrity.	Enhanced through database validations and the structured nature of the key-value pair setup.
Impact on MicroStrategy Environment and Server	Might strain the server, impacting performance and stability.	Less impact on MSTR server, requires efficient database management for smooth integration.
